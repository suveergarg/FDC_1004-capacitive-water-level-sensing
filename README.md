# FDC_1004-capacitive-water-level-sensing

FDC_1004 is a capacitance to digital encoder manufactured by Texas Instruments for capacitive sensing applications. It is a 4 channel device and uses the I2C protocol. 

This is the firmware for AVR micro-controllers to communicate with the FDC module and measure each of its channels and configure its control registers. It is specifically written for liquid sensing applications , but can be easily modified for other purposes.
